# How I create a PowerBI report

## Context & purposes:
To keep a report/dashboard visited by users, it is very important to consider many factors besides the technical aspect of Power BI.

I would like to share my view from my working experience with Power BI so far.

The data used is taken from kaggle for visualization purposes only, nothing related to the companies that I used to work for.

## Quick summary with video


## Why there can be a low Power Bi adoption (less users) through time? 
Here are some reasons that I observed:
- Firsly, THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS: 
  • Insights are not useful for  business actions 
  • Insights are not actionable enough for the audiences 
  • Don’t trust the results/insights (black box problem)
- VISUALIZYTION:
  • Too complicated to interpret, only serve the purpose of a small group 
  • Too much details, redundant things that people don’t expect, or too simple
- DATABASE: 
  • Not updated in time, slow 
  • Not enough data, or the data is unreliable 
  • Lack of data maintenance
- AUDIENCES: 
  • Conservative, not ready to change (e.g prefer Excel) 
  • Lack of data culture within a department
